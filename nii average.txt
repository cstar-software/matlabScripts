nii_average restoration:

- iterate nii/output/XXXX for all patients
- run nii_mean_stdev_roi_2 with fnm =
	/pre/std_space/perfusion_norm.nii.gz 
 	/post/std_space/perfusion_norm.nii.gz

and roi = rvascular.nii (NOTE: how did convert the .hdr and .img into a .nii?)

- make a modified nii_mean_stdev_roi_2 that takes an array of rois by number:
	[3,4,5,6,15,16] I think?

- mask out
	mimg = img(rimg == roi(i)); 
	mimg = img(mimg > 0); % voxels that are > 0?? can't remember

- count the difference of voxels from start to end and take percentage.
	orig = numel(mimg) ??


- nii_mean_stdev_roi_2 returns a mean/median value and % of voxels that survived the masking

- .csv file has the following header for both a mean and median file:

Subject,Pre-LMCA,%,Pre-RMCA,%,Pre-LPCA,%,Pre-RPCA,%,Pre-RCERA(15),%,Pre-LCERA(16),%,Post-LMCA,%,Post-RMCA,%,Post-LPCA,%,Post-RPCA,%,Post-RCERA(15),%,Post-LCERA(16),%
